# Wiresharktool
 In this activity, I have demostrated my Wireshark skills in field like:
1)Explore data with Wireshark
2)Apply a basic Wireshark filter and inspect a packet
3)Use filters to select packets
4)Use filters to explore DNS packets
5)Use filters to explore TCP packets

What i learned from this demostration is:

#1. Network protocol analyzers such as Wireshark, which has a graphical user interface or GUI, can help you examine packet data during your investigations.
#2.Since network packet data is complex, network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) like Wireshark are designed to help you find patterns and filter the data in order to focus on the network traffic that is most relevant to your security investigations.
#3.Coloring rules are used to provide high-level visual cues to help you quickly classify the different types of data
